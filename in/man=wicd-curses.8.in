.SH NAME
.B wicd-curses
\- curses-based wicd(8) controller
.SH DESCRIPTION
wicd-curses is a curses-based network controller that uses the Wired/Wireless Internet Connection Daemon (wicd) to control your network connections. It is suitable to run in terminal multiplexers like screen(1).

It is designed to imitate the GTK-based wicd-client(1) as much as possible, and uses the Urwid (http://excess.org/urwid) console widget library to vastly simplify development.

This man page only documents the current status of wicd-curses.  This may/may not be the most up-to-date document.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
These are not implemented yet.
.TP
.BR "\-r" , " \-\-raw\-screen"

This is a CURSES-based client for wicd.  It is designed to imitate wicd-client
as much as can be done with a console-based interface.  It is written using the
Urwid (http://excess.org/urwid) toolkit, and thus requires it.

That's all there is to it, really.  It's not going to install itself until I 
work on it more and figure out how to use distutils.

Right now, it only lists current available networks, and whether you are
connected to anything or not, and that is updated in real time.  It does not 
actually connect you to anything yet.  I'll get on that when I have more free
time than I do now (which will be soon).

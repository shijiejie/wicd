This is a curses-based client for wicd.  It is designed to imitate wicd-client
as much as can be done with a console-based interface.  It is written using the
Urwid (http://excess.org/urwid) toolkit, and thus requires it.

That's all there is to it, really.  It's not going to install itself until I 
work on it more and figure out how to use distutils.

Right now, it lists current available networks, and whether you are connected
to anything or not, all of which is updated in real time.  It will actually 
connect you to networks now.  Configuring them is something soon to come soon.

Controls:

F5     : refresh wireless networks
F8 or Q: quit 
D      : disconnect from active network
ESC    : if connecting to a network, stop doing so
ENTER  : Attempt connection to selected network
P      : Display preferences dialog

IN DIALOGS:
ESC or Q: Quit dialog without saving information (if present)

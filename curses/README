This is a curses-based client for wicd.  It is designed to imitate wicd-client
as much as can be done with a console-based interface.  It is written using the
Urwid (http://excess.org/urwid) toolkit, and thus requires it.

That's all there is to it, really.  It installs unless you disable when you
call setup.py

Right now, it lists current available networks, and whether you are connected
to anything or not, all of which is updated in real time.  It will actually 
connect you to networks now.  Global preferences are now configurable from the
console.  Per-network settings is a work in progress.

Controls:

F5     : refresh wireless networks
F8 or Q: quit 
D      : disconnect from active network
ESC    : if connecting to a network, stop doing so
ENTER  : Attempt connection to selected network
P      : Display preferences dialog
C      : Display network configuration for selected network
A      : Display "About" dialog

IN DIALOGS:
ESC or Q: Quit dialog without saving information (if present)
Meta+Left/Right: Change tabs Left/Right
Meta+Enter : Quit dialog and save information

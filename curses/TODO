Things to do (in no particular order):

*   Implement the ability to connect/disconnect to/from stuff.
    Yeah, I know that it's important...
*   Make a settings dialog
    * Implement something that resembles a combo box in urwid
*   Make a network config dialog
*   Make an about dialog
*   Implement a keyhandler function for the overall frame
    * Make keystrokes customizable
*   Make color schemes customizable
*   Add code to restore the terminal if _anything_ bad happens.  I have an idea about
    how to do it.  Ask me about it if you know some Python.

Oh, and most importantly:

* Tell people how they can quit the app (F8, until I do all of that stuff) :-)

Anything else?  That's all I can think of now.

Things to do (in no particular order):

*   Make a settings dialog -- Finish the backend.  The frontend is pretty much
    done.
*   Make a network config dialog
*   Make an about dialog
*   Implement a keyhandler function for the overall frame
    * Make keystrokes customizable
*   Make color schemes customizable
*   Integrate this with the my local copy of the experimental branch
*   Give some indication of activity during the connection process
*   Make a man page for the UI.

Oh, and most importantly:

*   Tell people how they can quit the app in the app (F8 or Q, until I do all of
    that stuff) :-)

Anything else?  That's all I can think of now.

Things to do (in no particular order):

*   Integrate a glib mainloop into the UI so that it can be aware of whether
    we're connecting or not by some means.
*   Implement the ability to connect/disconnect to/from stuff.
    Yeah, I know that it's important...
*   Make a settings dialog
    * Implement something that resembles a combo box in urwid
*   Make a network config dialog

Oh, and most importantly:

* Tell people how they can quit the app (F8, until I do all of that stuff) :-)

Anything else?  That's all I can think of now.
